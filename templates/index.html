  <h1>‚ò∫Ô∏è Gather Safe</h1>
  <h2>Unique Code for your event/venue</h1>
  <div id="qrcode"></div>
  <p>You can also tap <a href="SMSTO:+14176682737;?&body={{ .Uuid }}">this link</a> on your phone to check in. The unique ID for your event/venue is: <b>{{ .Uuid }}</b></p>
  <h2>‚ùî What is this? </h2>
  <p>
    This is a system that allows you and your friends to check-in to an event together. Then if you test positive for COVID-19, let us know
    and we'll tell everyone else anonymously.
  </p>
  <h2>üéâ How do I use this as an attendee?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Scan the QR Code and send the SMS to the number. We'll send you a message confirming you checked in. Show this to the host to get in.</li>
    <li>If you test positive, simply reply POSITIVE. We'll tell other attendees without mentioning you in any way.</li>
    <li>If someone in an event you attended tested positive, we'll send you an SMS without any identifying info about the positive case.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>üìã How do I use this page as an event host?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Print this page or take a screenshot of it.</li>
    <li>Have each attendee scan the QR Code and send the SMS when entering your event.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Other Questions</h1>
  <h2>How is close-contact defined?</h2>
  <p>
    We will notify you if someone who told us they test positive scanned the same QR code within three hours of you. This is imperfect.
  </p>

  <h2>How is my data stored?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I use Google App Engine, and store the ID that identifies each event alongside the phone number.</li>
    <li>I'm going to implement a job to scrub all data after 14 days.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why does this exist? </h2>
  <p>Getting COVID sucks. Even worse still, it's really hard to phone up or contact people you care about
    telling them that you've gotten it. Even though there shouldn't be, there is a certain stigma attached to
    getting COVID. We live in a pandemic, but somehow when we get sick as individuals, it must be because we did something wrong
    individually that wrought this disease upon us. This is bad both because it is crippling to our emotional
    wellbeing, but also because it is terrible for public health. 
  </p>
  <p>
    By making it so that the process for notifying people you tested positive is more frictionless and anonymous,
    we hope to make it less anxiety-inducing to report a positive case. You have enough to worry about if you test positive. 
  </p>
  <h2>What was this inspired by?</h2>
  <p>
    In large part, this website is a simple, hacky clone of the National SMS Contact Tracing System currently
    used in Taiwan, except on a much smaller scale, between friends.
